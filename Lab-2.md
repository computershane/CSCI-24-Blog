Welcome everyone to the board meeting and thank you for the taking the time out of your day to involve yourselves’ in our Red Team meeting.   We have analyzed the data in the Office 365 Platform, and it seems that although the antispam and antimalware is working as intending, we are getting a lot of noise on our systems, which keeps generating tickets for the IT team to address.  This affects the performance of the IT team in a vast array of things.  One is that this is increasing the workload for the IT team and thus driving down their normal productivity from their daily routine.  We need our IT team to stay focused and address the SEIM related tickets as they for the critical infrastructure of our company.  They must pay close attention to the threats that are occurring when our client’s vulnerable Line of Business apps show signs of a potential breach.  Afterall, we are a Security Operations Center, and we must adhere to each of our clients Service Level Agreements in all facets.  
Now we know that our clients are primarily Managed Service Providers.  We all know that they can and are the noisiest of all our clients.  They complain and call us on every nit-picking little thing.  Some do not even know how to use Google.  As with most MSP’s, they are cheap, and they do not have the brightest technicians to implement their own security control measures.   For the most part these technician’s barley even qualifies as level 1’s in my book.  Most of their technician’s call us on-a-daily regarding the 365 noise and thus we answer the simple questions repetitiously by analyzing the data to determine it is just another simple mail phishing campaign. But let’s not discuss their inept and let’s put that aside.    
 After running a cost/benefit analysis, I have determined the best solution would be to remove this useless debacle of the percentage of tickets we get from the MSP side regarding the phishing campaigns.  I have researched many different solutions to address the TT& E an implementing a solution that can give our company of better ROI with increased scalability in us adhering to our own SLA’s.  What I am talking about is a solution to removed 97% of our workload based on the need to train our MSP’s and thus adversely they can train their clients.  This solution is called PII Protect.
PII Protest’s primary objective is to make sure that our clients are educated as much as possible with regards to social engineering, phishing campaigns’, etc.  We no longer must have our IT team wasting countless hours on the phone re educating our MSP’s on educating their clients.  With PII Protect, the knowledge comes from turnkey Security Awareness Training that all our MSP’s and clients must adhere to.  In fact, we can offer them a discount on each node for $5 as an enticement.  What this will do is cause our Red Team to be able to schedule to conduct pen testing at a much faster rate, and thus the revenue will increase.  So as I said the ROI will be better on the first year we will save us $50,000.  On top of that, the first year we should be able to schedule more Pen tests per year which could give us an even higher ROI of $100,000 annually.  I have created a new security policy that the MSP’s will have to adhere to take advantage of the $5 off each node.  The TCO will only cost $15,000 to implement, let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, and if we can go forward today.
